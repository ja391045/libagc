# kOS KSP Library.

## You Probably Don't Want To Use This ##

This lib is in a constant state of flux, and I use it for tooling around in KSP with the [kOS mod](https://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS/).

I start this library like at least 5 years ago, and every once in a while I get to hacking on it.    It's been so long, I don't even remember what AGC stands for.

## How To Use ##

Pretty much install KSP, the KoS mod, and optionally the KoS For All mod which adds kOS CPUs to all capsules, cockpits and probe control cores.   Put all these files into your KSP Install Folder's Ships/Scripts directory.  Go ahead and make the Scripts directory if it doesn't exist.    Then, when you build a ship, select "boot.ks" as the boot file for the kOS CPU.   Finally, make top level script for your mission named after the ship in /bin/missions/\<ship\_name\>.ks.

Anyway, this isn't really for public consumption, but do whatever you want with it.
